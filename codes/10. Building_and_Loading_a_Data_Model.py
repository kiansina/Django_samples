'''
In this assignment you will temporarily step away from building the applications and develop a data model from a
file of un-normalized data and then build a script to load data in to that model. It is quite common to build a web
site and then need to pre-load it with data from a file or API.
'''

"""
The data is a simplified extraction of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites registry (https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/).
The un-normalized data is provided as both a spreadsheet and a CSV file:

CSV Version: https://www.dj4e.com/assn/dj4e_load/whc-sites-2018-clean.csv

XLS Version: https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dj4e.com%2Fassn%2Fdj4e_load%2Fwhc-sites-2018-small.xls&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK


The columns in the data are as follows:

name,description,justification,year,longitude,latitude,
area_hectares,category,state,region,iso

You have to have the CSV data available to run the batch script. If you are using PythonAnywhere to do your homework,
you can use the wget command to pull in the data (see below).
"""

#### Getting Started:
"""
We will do this assignment in a new Django project called batch so as not to disturb your other work.
"""
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$:
mkvirtualenv django3 # These are necessary to go forward.
workon django3 # These are necessary to go forward.
pip install django
#-------------------------
cd ~/django_projects
django-admin startproject batch
/$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

"""
Make new application under your django_projects/batch called unesco.
"""

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$:
cd ~/django_projects/batch
python manage.py startapp unesco
/$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


"""
You need to copy the CSV file into the unesco folder. If the wget command is available you can use it to download
the file:
"""

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$:
cd unesco
wget https://www.dj4e.com/assn/dj4e_load/whc-sites-2018-clean.csv
/$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

"""
Also make a folder called scripts and add an __init__.py file to it. The __init__.py file is needed in order to store
Python objects in the scripts folder.
"""


$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$:
cd ~/django_projects/batch
mkdir scripts
touch scripts/__init__.py
/$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


"""
Make a copy of the many_load.py from this folder into your scripts folder:

https://github.com/csev/dj4e-samples/tree/main/scripts

Then in install django extensions if you have not already done so:
"""

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$:
workon django3                     # or django4 (if needed)
pip install django_extensions
/$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


"""
Add the following line to your batch/batch/settings.py:
"""

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
...
    'django_extensions', # Add
    'unesco.apps.UnescoConfig',  # Add
]


"""
At this point you should run:
"""

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$:
python manage.py check
/$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


"""
And make sure that your basic Django environment is configured properly.
"""



#### Design a Data Model

"""
We need to design a database model that represents this flat data across multiple tables using "third-normal form"
- which basically means that columns that have vertical duplication, such as region:
"""

category    state                  region                      iso

Cultural    Afghanistan            Asia and the Pacific        af
Cultural    Afghanistan            Asia and the Pacific        af
Cultural    Albania                Europe and North America    al
Cultural    Albania                Europe and North America    al
Cultural    Algeria                Arab States                 dz
Mixed       Algeria                Arab States                 dz
Cultural    Algeria                Arab States                 dz
Cultural    Algeria                Arab States                 dz


"""
We will use a Django model that describes the tables, one-to-many relationships, and foreign keys sufficient to
represent this data efficiently with no vertical duplication of string values. Numbers and dates do not have to
have their own tables.
"""



from django.db import models

class Category(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128, default="")
    def __str__(self) :
        return self.name

class State(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128, default="")
    def __str__(self) :
        return self.name

class Iso(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128, default="")
    def __str__(self) :
        return self.name

class Region(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128, default="")
    def __str__(self) :
        return self.name

class Site(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=300)
    year = models.IntegerField(null=True)
    latitude = models.FloatField(null=True)
    longitude = models.FloatField(null=True)
    description = models.TextField(null=True)
    justification = models.TextField(null=True)
    area_hectares = models.FloatField(null=True)
    category = models.ForeignKey("Category", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)
    region = models.ForeignKey("Region", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)
    iso = models.ForeignKey("Iso", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)
    state = models.ForeignKey("State", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)

    def __str__(self) :
        return self.name


"""
Draw the above data model using Crow's-Foot Notation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model).
You can use paper, or a layout tool - one way or another your diagram should have five boxes and four lines - and the
each of lines should be properly labelled as a "many" or a "one" end.

Once you have your model built, run makemigrations and migrate to create the database.
"""


$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$:
cd ~/django_projects/batch
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
/$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

"""
You can repeat the process of editing the models.py file and re-running the migrations steps until you get them right.
"""


#### Loading Data Into Your Database

"""
Django has a special runscript capability that allows you to write a Python program to read and write the database
using your Django models.

There is a simple example of how to write such a script in the dj4e-samples respository:


Many-to-Many / Data Model: https://github.com/csev/dj4e-samples/blob/main/many/models.py

Many-to-Many / Script: https://github.com/csev/dj4e-samples/blob/main/scripts/many_load.py

"""

"""
See the file load.csv and many_load.py for and example of how you look through a file, insert model data and make
foreign key connections. A key technique is in this bit of code:
"""

p, created = Person.objects.get_or_create(email=row[0])


"""
This code insures that there is a row in the Person table for the email address that was just read row[0]. The email
address may or may not already be in the table from a previous line in the file. One way or another, by the end of this
line of code p contains a reference to a Person stored in the database that can be used to fullfill a foreign key later
in the code.

Note that the "p, created" is an example of Python function returning two values using a tuple.
"""

m = Membership(role=r,person=p, course=c)
m.save()


"""
The line to make the Membership row is the last thing that is done so all the foreign key connections can be made.

Notice that the code empties the three tables out every time and freshly reloads all the data so the process can be run
over and over.
"""

#### Dealing with Empty Columns

"""
Your data will be more complex than the sample, You will need to deal with situations where an integer column like the
year will be empty. First, add null=True to numeric columns that can be empty in your models.py. Then, before inserting
the Site record, check the year to see if it is a valid integer and if it is not a valid integer set it to None which
will become NULL (or empty) in the data base when inserted:
"""


try:
    y = int(row[3])
except:
    y = None

...

site = Site(name=row[0], description=row[1], year=y, ... )
site.save()

"""
You will need to do this for each of the numeric fields that might be missing or have invalid data.
"""

#### Running the Script


"""
Place the CSV file in the unesco folder and then run the script from the project folder (i.e. where the manage.py file
resides):
"""

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$:
cd ~/django_projects/batch
workon django4                             # Or django3 (if necessary)
python manage.py runscript many_load
/$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

"""
It needs to be run this way so that lines like:

from unesco.models import Site, Iso, ....

work properly.
"""


#### Checking Your Data By Hand

"""
You can also hand-check your data by running a few queries on your data before turning it in to make sure the data makes
it into the right tables:
"""

$ sqlite3 db.sqlite3
SQLite version 3.24.0 2018-06-04 14:10:15
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> SELECT count(id) FROM unesco_state;
163
sqlite> SELECT count(id) FROM unesco_site;
1044
sqlite> SELECT count(id) FROM unesco_state where name="India";
1
sqlite> SELECT count(id) FROM unesco_site WHERE name="Hawaii Volcanoes National Park" AND year=1987 AND area_hectares = 87940.0;
