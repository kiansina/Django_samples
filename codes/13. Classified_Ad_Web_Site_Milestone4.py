#### Classified Ad Web Site - Milestone 4

'''
n this assignment, you will expand your classified ads web site to add search and tags functionality
equivalent to:

https://chucklist.dj4e.com/m4

Important: The number of lines you need to add to your code is relatively small. Take your time read the
sample code carefully - only make changes that you understand. Wholesale cutting and pasting sample code
will make it almost impossible to complete this assignment.

This is somewhat like the kind of real work you do when you have a working application and want to add a
feature the the application. First - don't break what you have working.'''

#### Adding Search
"""
The well sample application contains code you can adapt to implement the code to search the title and text:

https://samples.dj4e.com/well/

To avoid getting too much broken at one time - it is probably a good idea to make search work and then
further evolve your code to support tags.

#### Adding Support for Tags

"""
The tagme application adds a tags field to the model and and adds support for tags to the user interface
and search code.

You should also review the documentation for the django-taggit library at:

https://django-taggit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

You might find the easiest path is to use the taggit documentation to make your changes, looking at the
tagme code to verify what you are doing.
